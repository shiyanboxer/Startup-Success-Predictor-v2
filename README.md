### **Quickstart**
Traditionally, venture capital is considered more of an art than a science. Venture capitalists meet with founders, perform due diligence, and try to make the most informed investment decision; however, due to the nature of early-stage companies, financial and traction metrics are often scarce.

### **About**
With the influx and access to data in recent decades, venture capitalists have turned to machine learning and artificial intelligence to help guide them in their investment decisions and explore market trends. Typically these models are not meant to replace VCs but rather enable them to quantify opportunities and avoid bias as much as possible.

This web application leverages data science, machine learning, and business principles to predict the success of startups based on common characteristics. The goal is to ensure reliability, scalability, and ease of use. The program is an end to end solution consisting of five parts: 

1. **Clean - **cleans dataset before building the model
2. **Model **- predicts success 
3. **API **- allows requests to the model
4. **Database **- stores company data
5. **Frontend **- allows user to inputs criteria

### **Technologies** 
- React to build the frontend
- MongoDB to build the database
- Python in Jupyter Notebook to build the model and clean
- Flask to build the API

### **Learnings**

### **Challenges**

### **What I Would Do Differently**

### **Next Steps**
The following is a list of features that are out of scope for this project but would be worthwhile exploring in future iterations. These features would provide a more comprehensive and desirable user experience.

*   Use Tensorflow to automatically classify pictures
*   Train dataset on multiple datasets
*   Add additional criteria
*   Explore other models
*   Add authentication
