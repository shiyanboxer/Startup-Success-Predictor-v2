### **Quickstart**
```
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **About**
This web application leverages data science, machine learning, and business principles to predict the success of startups based on common characteristics. The goal is to ensure reliability, scalability, and ease of use. The program is an end to end solution consisting of five parts: 

1. **Clean** cleans dataset before building the model
2. **Model** predicts success 
3. **API** allows requests to the model
4. **Database** stores company data
5. **Frontend** allows user to inputs criteria

### **Technologies** 
- **React** to build the frontend
- **MongoDB** to build the database
- **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook** to build the model and clean
- **Flask** to build the API

### **Demo**

### **What I Would Do Differently**

### **Next Steps**
The following is a list of features that are out of scope for this project but would be worthwhile exploring in future iterations. These features would provide a more comprehensive and desirable user experience.
- Train dataset on multiple datasets
- Add additional criteria
- Explore other models
- Add authentication
