## **Testing**

The following types of test were preformed.

**Component/subsystem testing:** each subcomponent needs to be thoroughly tested during the prototype stage
**Integration testing:** test to see if different components/subsystem communicate the way they should
**Full system testing (unit testing):** how the entire system works after integration of all the components
**Field testing:** testing the product in scenarios very close to how the final product/system will be used.
**Iteration on user testing and feedback:** when the product is stable, more rounds of user testing might be required to understand if users want the product and how they would use it. Based on feedback minor changes
**Beta release:** beta release are meant to flush out bugs that happen in scale or might have escaped previous rounds - fix before release


## **Next Steps**

The following is a list of features that are out of scope for this project but would be worthwhile exploring in future
iterations. These features would provide a more comprehensive and desirable user experience.

- Create and connect a database, instead of using an excel sheet to hold company info
- Train and test on multiple datasets, not
  just [Crunchbase](https://www.kaggle.com/arindam235/startup-investments-crunchbase/data)
- Add additional parameters such as country, number of rounds raised, number of founders
- Explore and compare other models such as random forest
- Explore other methods of validating the results of the model such as MSE and MAE
