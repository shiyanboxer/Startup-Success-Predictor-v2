# 5. **Testing, Contributing, Versioning, & Learning Resources**

## **Testing**
The application was thoroughly tested using CirclCI, Postman, and Google Console, and React App frontend to ensure no errors before a branch was merged to master. This ensured the build isn't broken by changes in code logic.

## **Contributing**
1. Submit an issue (feature request or bug)
2. Create a branch: git checkout -b feature/feature-implementing
3. Commit changes to the branch: git add . && git commit -m "Present tense commit message"
4. Push the changes: git push -u origin feature/feature-implementing
5. Submit a pull request
